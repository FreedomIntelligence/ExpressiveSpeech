## 📖 Introduction

Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models can generate intelligible speech but often lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable evaluation metric. To address this, we present **DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive Preference of eAR)**, a novel framework that converts human preferences for speech expressiveness into an objective score.

Grounded in phonetics and psychology, DeEAR evaluates speech across three core dimensions: **Emotion**, **Prosody**, and **Spontaneity**. It achieves strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.

Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data curation. We applied DeEAR to build **ExpressiveSpeech**, a high-quality dataset, and used it to fine-tune an S2S model, which improved its overall expressiveness score from 2.0 to 23.4 (on a 100-point scale).



## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Multi-dimensional Objective Scoring**: Decomposes speech expressiveness into quantifiable dimensions of Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity.
*   **Strong Alignment with Human Perception**: Achieves a Spearman's Rank Correlation (SRCC) of **0.86** with human ratings for overall expressiveness.
*   **Data-Efficient and Scalable**: Requires minimal annotated data, making it practical for deployment and scaling.
*   **Dual Applications**:
    1.  **Automated Model Benchmarking**: Ranks SOTA models with near-perfect correlation (SRCC = **0.96**) to human rankings.
    2.  **Evaluation-Driven Data Curation**: Efficiently filters and curates high-quality, expressive speech datasets.
*   **Release of ExpressiveSpeech Dataset**: A new large-scale, bilingual (English-Chinese) dataset containing ~14,000 utterances of highly expressive speech.



## 🔧 Framework Overview

The DeEAR framework follows a four-stage pipeline designed to decompose, model, and ultimately align the abstract concept of expressiveness with human preference.
